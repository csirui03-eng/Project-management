## Regular expressions (REGEX) 
A mini-language first implemented by Ken Thomspon in the Unix text editor with the ed standalone program, then implemented into the grep standalone program("Global regular expression print") which is still used today in mac and linux systems.

### Brief history: 
- Basic REGEX - The original ed/grep versions. Minimal
- Extended REGEX - adding + , ? , | (or) and grouping function using ( )
- Perl Compatible (PCRE) - Perl compatible regex, massively expanded


For my purpose in python it is a mini-language for explaining text patterns. 

```python
import re #Library that reads REGEX
```
