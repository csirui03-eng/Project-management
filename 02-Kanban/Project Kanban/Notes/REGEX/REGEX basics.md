## Regular expressions (REGEX) 
A concept first implemented by Ken Thomspon in the Unix text editor as ed, then implemented into grep ("Global regular expression print") which is still used today in mac and linux systems.

For my purpose in python it is a mini-language for explaining text patterns. 

```python
import re #Library that reads REGEX
```
