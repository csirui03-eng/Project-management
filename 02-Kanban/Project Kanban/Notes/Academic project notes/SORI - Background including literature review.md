	- [ ] **Low-frequency transmission** → LRS (Leave for last, hardest)
	- [ ] **Coincidence frequency** → phononic crystals (Do first, easiest)
	- [ ] **Perimeter gaps** → metasurfaces (Do second, complex but not so complex?)
	- [ ] **Design methodology** → ML/NN for optimization of complex hybrid systems (supplementary)

## Broad context
### Key terms: 
**Why it matters (motivation):**

- "urban noise pollution health effects"
- "building acoustics occupant wellbeing"
- "inter-tenancy noise complaints"
- "acoustic comfort residential buildings"
- "noise exposure sleep quality"

**Traditional door/partition acoustics:**

- "door sound transmission loss"
- "STC rating doors"
- "acoustic door design"
- "mass law sound insulation"
- "perimeter seal acoustics"
- "door gap sound leakage"

**Metamaterials entering the space (transitional):**

- "acoustic metamaterials building applications"
- "metamaterial sound insulation"
- "locally resonant structures sound transmission"
- "phononic crystal partition"
- "acoustic metasurface noise control"

**Review papers are gold for broad context:**

- Add "review" to any of the above
- Gets you papers that already synthesize the field
- Great source of citations to chase

### Approach
Basically, noise fucks up your health.... 
A few pathways
- Direct hearing damage
	- 85+dB(A) for more then 8 hours will cause permanent damage 
	- Permanent damage is bad
	- Kinda like fatigue loads at above fatigue limit? 
		- Damage accumulates but ears can recover on its own
			- Too complex to map out for introduction
- Stress hormones
	- Noise generally triggers physiological stress responses in humans and can do so at levels common in urban residential neighbor hoods, well below what people would consider loud. (65 dB(A))
	- This aspect is what makes it a public health problem that is worth addressing through better building acoustics
- Sleep disruption
	- Random unwanted noises at 30 dB(A) can just fuck up your sleep through I guess direct mental stimulation
- Cognitive interference
	- Same mechanism as sleep disruption, unwanted auditory signals messes with concentration. More or a behavior thing at a certain level, 
- Psychological - just a link to another key health criteria listed by the WHO
- Behavioral changes - People change their behavior as a way for coping with all the above issues. Quite a weak link
