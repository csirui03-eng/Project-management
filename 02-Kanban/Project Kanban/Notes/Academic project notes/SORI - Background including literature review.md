## Funnel Approach
- [ ] Broad Context
- [ ] Foundational concepts
- [ ] Specific research streams
	- [ ] **Low-frequency transmission** → LRS
	- [ ] **Coincidence frequency** → phononic crystals
	- [ ] **Perimeter gaps** → metasurfaces
	- [ ] **Design methodology** → ML/NN for optimization of complex hybrid systems

## Broad context
### Key terms: 
**Why it matters (motivation):**

- "urban noise pollution health effects"
- "building acoustics occupant wellbeing"
- "inter-tenancy noise complaints"
- "acoustic comfort residential buildings"
- "noise exposure sleep quality"

**Traditional door/partition acoustics:**

- "door sound transmission loss"
- "STC rating doors"
- "acoustic door design"
- "mass law sound insulation"
- "perimeter seal acoustics"
- "door gap sound leakage"

**Metamaterials entering the space (transitional):**

- "acoustic metamaterials building applications"
- "metamaterial sound insulation"
- "locally resonant structures sound transmission"
- "phononic crystal partition"
- "acoustic metasurface noise control"

**Review papers are gold for broad context:**

- Add "review" to any of the above
- Gets you papers that already synthesize the field
- Great source of citations to chase

### Approach
Basically, noise fucks up your health.... 
A few pathways
- Direct hearing damage
	- 85+dB(A) for more then 8 hours will cause permanent damage 
	- Permanent damage is bad
	- Kinda like fatigue loads at above fatigue limit? 
		- Damage accumulates but ears can recover on its own
			- Too complex to map out for introduction
- Stress hormones
	- Noise generally triggers physiological stress responses in humans and can do so at levels common in urban residential neighbor hoods, well below what people would consider loud.
	- This aspect is what makes it a public health problem wor
- Sleep disruption
- Cognitive interference
- Psychological
- Behavioral changes
