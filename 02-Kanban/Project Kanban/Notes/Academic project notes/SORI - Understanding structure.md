# Top priority! Add some ML stuff in here!

### Title (Low priority)

Pretty straight forward, uh, just write this last, or get something to generate it? straight forward.

--- 
### Background, including literature review

The bulk of the work. Umm, yea, vlad said 10 sources? So I guess I gotta skim 10 papers, should be pretty straight forward. 

- [ ] Check Andrew's proposal
- [ ] Check Vladislav's paper
- [ ] Scavenge for more like the rat I am

The good example umm, has **_891_** word, very extensive, but I guess if its like 10 sources its basically, 80 word per source?

### Significance and contribution

Basically justifying why the research is important

For Lin's document, his three paragraph serves these purposes: 
1. Problem/Gap in existing research (**60** words)
2. Response (***55*** words)
3. Impact (***89*** words)

### Methodology 

Just to show that you understand the typical research process, is flexible through the actual 3 year research process.

1. **Literature Review** — Understand ABH theory, history, and identify knowledge gaps
2. **Theoretical Analysis** — Develop dynamical models and numerical methods for ABH structures
3. **Design & Modelling** — Simulate structures using software, analyze geometric and material parameters
4. **Manufacturing** — Explore 3D printing and laser cutting for fabrication
5. **Experimental Testing** — Validate predictions using laser visualization, shakers, accelerometers
6. **Multiple ABH Configurations** — Investigate arrays of ABHs for improved attenuation (Obviously for me this would be a different thing, I guess I would write about investigation of multiple systems to try and make the door work as best as it can.)
7. **Real-World Application** — Apply to noise reduction in panels, leverage industry connections

### Expected outcome 

Just yap about what you want to achieve!
