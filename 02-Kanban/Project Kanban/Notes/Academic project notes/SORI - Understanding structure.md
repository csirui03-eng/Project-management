The bulk of the work. Umm, yea, vlad said 10 sources? So I guess I gotta skim 10 papers, should be pretty straight forward. 

- [ ] Check Andrew's proposal
- [ ] Check Vladislav's paper
- [ ] Scavenge for more like the rat I am

The good example umm, has **_891_** word, very extensive, but I guess if its like 10 sources its basically, 80 word per source?
