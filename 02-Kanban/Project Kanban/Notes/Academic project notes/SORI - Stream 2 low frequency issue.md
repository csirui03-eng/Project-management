- First ever LRS demonstration
- Very different construction, artifical atom almost
	- Not applicable to building acoustics yet but viable
	- Has the issue of the sharp anti-resonance after the resonance

- Mr. Andrew starting with experiments with what Liu made, progressing to discreet single resonance local mechanical resonators and to multi resonance systems
- Multi resonance models works well! reduces peaks and reduces troughs which is very impressive. 
- Key work here is ways to reduce the anti resonance behavior...

- Experiments with multiple multi resonance multi layer systems with some configurations towards the end showing great promise in achieving near identical performance to total mass law models while retaining the TL peaks and curbing the TL troughs.
