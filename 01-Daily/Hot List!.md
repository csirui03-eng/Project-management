	- [ ] Advance understanding in systems introduced by Andrew's document
		- [ ] Locally resonant structures
		- [ ] Acoustic meta surfaces
		- [ ] Photonic Crystals
		- [ ] Phase Gradient Materials
	- [ ] Mechanics by Lifshitz
	- [ ] Advance understanding of the residential door market
		- [ ] NZ building code structural requirements
			- [ ] Clause B1 (structure)
			- [ ] Clause B2 (durability)
		- [ ] Fire Resistance Ratings (FRR)
			- [ ] Fire testing is expensive
			- [ ] If we want to charge alot, ppl will be like, well, is it fireproof?
			- [ ] Also, less mass damping = less fire proofing and we don't want this to be a hazard
